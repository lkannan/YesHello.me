# Yes, Say Hello – Because Conversations Start with a Greeting! 👋  

## 🌟 Say Hello First!  
Conversations aren’t just about getting answers quickly; they’re about **connecting with people**.  
Imagine walking into a room and immediately demanding something—sounds a bit cold, right?  
A simple **"Hello"** goes a long way in making communication feel natural and respectful.

## ❌ Don't Be Like This:  
🚫 *"What time was that meeting?"*  
🚫 *"Send me the report."*  
🚫 *"Update those NFRs."*  

This feels **impersonal** and **transactional**—like treating people as search engines instead of human beings.  

---

## ✅ Instead, Try This:  
✅ *"Hey, how's your day going? By the way, what time was that meeting?"*  
✅ *"Hi there! Hope you're doing well. Could you send me the report when you have a moment?"*  
✅ *"Good morning! If you’re free, can you update those NFRs?"*  

A **small greeting** makes a **big difference!** 🎉

## 💡 Why This Matters:  
✔️ **Respects social norms** – We wouldn’t skip greetings in real life, so why do it in chat?  
✔️ **Builds relationships** – Work isn’t just about efficiency; it’s about people.  
✔️ **Adds warmth to digital spaces** – A quick **"hello"** makes remote work feel less robotic.

💙 **So go ahead—start with "Hello!"** Because good conversations start with kindness. 🩷
